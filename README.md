# bronco
Bronco is my personal PHP MVC Framework that I use on all my projects.

Note: As I grow and learn as a developer I am constantly making changes to Bronco. That said some parts of Bronco's library may not be 100% stable or as well tested as they should be. I do my best to only include code that works 100% but there are many times when you will see I leave snippets around for development inbetween pushes. Going forward I will do my best to make sure this is documented ( as well as the entire framework )


TODO
- Document framework
- Come up with an alternative Router design
- Implement better database management tools and classes's in Bronco
